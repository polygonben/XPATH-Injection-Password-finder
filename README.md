# XPATH-Injection-Password-finder
A tool using XPATH injections &amp; python to find the password of a user in the database. 
This tool is especially useful for blind XPATH injections!

This tool was wrote specifically for the picoCTF challenge 'X marks the Spot' however the code is simple and can be edited for 
to crack passwords on other web apps vulnerable to XPATH injections where we can use functions like starts-with(), count(), substring().
